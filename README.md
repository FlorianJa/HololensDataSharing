# HololensDataSharing

__WORK IN PREGESS__  

Datasharing between physical object and Hololens.


Hololens uses Vuforia SDK for reading visual markers (Vumarks) and place cubes on the position the marker is detected.  
The cube is used as placeholder object. The cube can be placed at the marker position or relativ to the marker position.  
The cube prefab can be replaced this any other prefab.
